After evaluating various options, I found Docusaurus to be the perfect balance of simplicity and functionality.\n\n## Why Docusaurus?\n\nWhen choosing a platform for my personal site, I had several requirements:\n- **Markdown Support**: Write content in simple Markdown\n- **React-Based**: Leverage React for custom components\n- **i18n Ready**: Built-in internationalization support\n- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search out of the box\n- **Dark Mode**: Modern theme switching capabilities\n- **Performance**: Static site generation for optimal loading\n\nDocusaurus checked all these boxes and more.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## Key Features I Implemented\n\n### 1. Internationalization (i18n)\n\nSetting up multi-language support was surprisingly straightforward:\n\n```javascript\ni18n: {\n  defaultLocale: 'en',\n  locales: ['en', 'zh'],\n  localeConfigs: {\n    en: {\n      label: 'English',\n      htmlLang: 'en-US',\n    },\n    zh: {\n      label: 'ä¸­æ–‡',\n      htmlLang: 'zh-CN',\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe locale dropdown in the navbar automatically handles language switching, making the site accessible to a global audience.\n\n### 2. Enhanced Search\n\nI integrated the `@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local` plugin for local search functionality:\n\n```javascript\nthemes: [\n  [\n    require.resolve(\"@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local\"),\n    {\n      hashed: true,\n      language: [\"en\", \"zh\"],\n      highlightSearchTermsOnTargetPage: true,\n    },\n  ],\n],\n```\n\nThis provides instant search results without needing external services.\n\n### 3. Automated Deployment\n\nUsing GitHub Actions, I set up automatic deployment to GitHub Pages:\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm run build\n      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3\n        with:\n          path: ./build\n```\n\nEvery push to main automatically builds and deploys the site!\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe organization I settled on:\n```\ndocs/\nâ”œâ”€â”€ intro.md           # Homepage\nâ”œâ”€â”€ notes/            # Technical notes\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ programming/  # Language-specific content\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools/       # Tool documentation\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ thoughts/    # Reflections and insights\nblog/                # Time-based blog posts\nsrc/\nâ””â”€â”€ pages/          # Custom React pages\n    â””â”€â”€ about.md    # About page\n```\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\nDocusaurus generates static HTML for each page, ensuring:\n- Fast initial page loads\n- Excellent SEO\n- Works without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)\n- Optimal Core Web Vitals scores\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Start Simple**: Don't over-engineer the initial setup\n2. **Use Built-in Features**: Docusaurus provides many features out of the box\n3. **Optimize Images**: Use appropriate formats and lazy loading\n4. **Test Locally**: Always run `npm run build` before deploying\n5. **Version Control Everything**: Including configuration and content\n\n## What's Next?\n\nI'm planning to add:\n- Comment system integration\n- RSS feed customization\n- Advanced MDX components\n- Analytics integration\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDocusaurus has proven to be an excellent choice for building a personal technical blog. Its balance of simplicity and power makes it perfect for developers who want to focus on content while having the flexibility to customize when needed.\n\nIf you're considering building a documentation site or technical blog, I highly recommend giving Docusaurus a try!\n\n---\n\n*Have questions about my setup?
